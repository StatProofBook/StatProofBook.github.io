**Definition:** Let $m$ be a [generative model](/D/gm) with [model parameters](/D/para) $\theta \in \Theta$ implying the [likelihood function](/D/lf) $p(y \vert \theta, m)$ and [prior distribution](/D/prior) $p(\theta \vert m)$. Moreover, assume an [approximate](/D/vb) [posterior distribution](/D/post) $q(\theta)$. Then, the [Variational Bayesian](/D/vb) [log model evidence](/D/lme), also referred to as the "variational free energy", is defined as the expected logarithm of the likelihood function, divided by the approximate posterior:

$$ \label{eq:vbLME}
\mathrm{vbLME}(m) = \mathrm{F}_m[q(\theta)] = \int_{\Theta} q(\theta) \log \frac{p(\theta \vert y, m)}{q(\theta)} \, \mathrm{d}\theta \; .
$$

The variational free energy can be decomposed into the [difference between log model evidence and KL divergence of approximate from true posterior](/P/fren-dec) or, alternatively, as the [difference of expected log-likelihood and KL divergence of approximate posterior from prior](/P/fren-dec).
