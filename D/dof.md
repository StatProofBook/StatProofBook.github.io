**Definition:** Degrees of freedom can refer to

* a [parameter](/D/para) or [parameters](/D/para) of certain [probability distributions](/D/dist), such as the [chi-squared distribution](/D/chi2), the [t-distribution](/D/t) or the [F-distribution](/D/f);

* the number of values in the final calculation of a [statistic](/D/stat) that are free to vary, such as $n-1$ for a [sample variance](/D/var-samp) calculated from $n$ [data points](/D/data).

Some [statistics](/D/stat) have [sampling distributions](/D/dist-samp) whose [parameters](/D/para) (in the former sense) are equal to their degrees of freedom (in the latter sense). For example, [a function of the sample variance follows a chi-squared distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom](/P/norm-chi2).
