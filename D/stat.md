**Definition:** A statistic, also "sample statistic", is any quantity calculated from the [data points](/D/data) in a [sample](/D/samp) that is used for statistical purposes.

Examples include statistics used to estimate the [parameters](/D/para) of a [probability distribution](/D/dist) and [test statistics](/D/tstat) to evaluate [statistical hypotheses](/D/hyp).
