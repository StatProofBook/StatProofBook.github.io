**Theorem:** Let $E$ be a [random event](/D/reve). Then, $E$ is [independent of itself](/D/ind), if and only if its [probability](/D/prob) is zero or one:

$$ \label{eq:ind-self}
E \text{ self-independent} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad P(E) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad P(E) = 1 \; .
$$


**Proof:** According to the definition of [statistical independence](/D/ind), it must hold that:

$$ \label{eq:ind}
\begin{split}
P(E,E) &= P(E) \cdot P(E) \\
P(E)   &= \left( P(E) \right)^2 \; .
\end{split}
$$

For $0 \leq P(E) \leq 1$, this is only fulfilled, if

$$ \label{eq:ind-self-qed}
P(E) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad P(E) = 1 \; .
$$

Both is possible, since the [lower bound of probability is zero](/D/prob-ax) and the [upper bound of probability is one](/P/prob-range).
