**Theorem:** The [probability](/D/prob) of the intersection of $A$ and $B$ is larger than or equal to the sum of the probabilities of $A$ and $B$ minus one:

$$ \label{eq:bool-ineq}
P(A \cap B) \geq P(A) + P(B) - 1 \; .
$$


**Proof:** The [addition law of probability](/P/prob-add) states that, for two [events](/D/reve) $A$ and $B$, it holds true that

$$ \label{eq:prob-add}
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \; .
$$

Rearranging for $P(A \cap B)$, we have:

$$ \label{eq:bool-ineq-s1}
P(A \cap B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cup B) \; .
$$

The [range of probability](/P/prob-range) is

$$ \label{eq:prob-range}
0 \leq P(E) \leq 1 \; .
$$

Thus, $P(A \cup B)$ is at most one. (This is the case, if $A$ and $B$ are [collectively exhaustive](/P/prob-exh) and their union is thus [equal to the sample space](/D/prob-ax) $\Omega$.) With this, we are able to derive a lower bound for $P(A \cap B)$, as given by the theorem:

$$ \label{eq:bool-ineq-qed}
P(A \cap B) \geq P(A) + P(B) - 1 \; .
$$
