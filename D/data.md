**Definition:** Data, also "measured data", are any set of one or more [random variables](/D/rvar) – [discrete or continuous](/D/rvar-disc), [univariate or multivariate](/D/rvar-uni) – that have been observed, measured or collected in the course of a [random experiment](/D/rexp).

The random variables that are part of data have [probability distributions](/D/dist). Assumptions for these probability distributions are made with [generative models](/D/gm). Generative models can form the basis for [statistical tests](/D/test) checking [statistical hypotheses](/D/hyp).
